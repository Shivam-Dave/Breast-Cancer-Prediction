# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the provided medical data, the model classifies tumors as either malignant or benign, facilitating early detection and treatment.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and extraction
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
